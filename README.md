# Student_Performance_Analysis
Peoples are constantly affected by the environment and the variables from which they surround themselves, If that individual is in the early stage of his life like under 25 then he is more prone to his environment. The same is applied to the student too, Every student’s life is composed and stimulated by different features whether it is a low-income family, family traditions, their parent’s education, community involvement, or race. Apart from these, there are other factors too like their social group on which they spend their free time, the support from parents, The activities on which they involve in their free time. So there are so many variables around which a student was surrounded and this environment impacts their behavior and ease of life, but do these things have any impact on the performance of their grades. This is a very important question that needs to be answered and Teachers need to understand that every student has been influenced by these demographic characteristics to be effective. So to answer these questions and analyze the impact of these attributes on the grades of the student I will use the student achievement dataset of two Portuguese schools.
